# 🚀 OpenSpringLab

**OpenSpringLab** is an open-source learning community focused on  
**learning Java & Spring Boot by building real backend projects together**.

This project was founded and is maintained by an unemployed Java developer who believes that  
**learning should never stop**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of OpenSpringLab is simple:

- Learn by doing
- Build real-world backend applications
- Practice Git, Pull Requests, and code reviews
- Grow together as a community

This is **not** a course, bootcamp, or paid program.  
This is a **hands-on, community-driven learning space**.

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?

- Java beginners
- Junior backend developers
- Self-taught developers
- Developers who want real GitHub experience
- Unemployed developers who want to stay active

No interviews.  
No pressure.  
Only learning.
